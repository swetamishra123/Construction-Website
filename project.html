                   <h3>Dhola Sadiya</h3>
                   <p> India's longest bridge, the 9.1km Dhola-Sadiya bridge,  to connect Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, also to boost tactical defences.
                    The Dhola–Sadiya Bridge, has completed construction of five bridges to cross the Debang river system as well.
                    One feature of the river is the possibility of flash floods. These floods do not come from rains alone but from melting of ice in the mountains.
                     So, they may occur during dry season after the winter in the mountains. Flash floods come suddenly; they could wash men, material and equipment.
                   The perennial river proper is only 4000m wide, but the bridge is 9150m long. When the river is in spate, it flows over a wide area.
                    The 9.15km stretch tries to cover this but there could be breaches during flooding. The structure over the flood plains is called viaducts. 
                    Viaduct on the Dhola side is 2600m long and on the Sadiya side it is 2550m  </p>

                <h3>Narendra Modi Stadium Roof Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The world’s largest cricket stadium, Narendra Modi Stadium (commonly known as Motera Stadium)
                            The stadium exists in tiers to accommodate smaller events and maintain the atmosphere for spectators even when the bowl isn’t full.
                             These tiers carry through to the roof being crucial it acted structurally independent. 
                             The city of Ahmedabad is located in a level 3 seismic zone. Due to this volatility, it was imperative the roof design be lightweight and seismically 
                             separate from the bowl to avoid compromising the roof in times of movement.

                   <p> The Brooklyn Bridge is the southernmost of four toll-free vehicular bridges connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island, with the Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro 
                    bridges to the north. Only passenger vehicles and pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted. A major tourist attraction since its opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has become 
                    an icon of New York City. Over the years, the bridge has been used as the location of various stunts and performances, as well as several crimes and attacks. The Brooklyn Bridge 
                    has been designated a National Historic Landmark, a New York City landmark, and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. </p>

                <p>
                    The bridge has a span of 150 m. Its useful width at the park end and in the middle is 4 m and widens towards the residential area as light-traffic lane divides to reach the two 
                  sides of the arch. Here the reinforced concrete abutment is founded on bored piles and on the other end the arch branches are anchored straight to the bedrock. The bridge’s 
                    superstructure is a steel construction and the orthotropic deck is suspended from the arch with 22 pairs of tension rods. Steel assemblies are welded together on site. The project
                 also includes construction of the pedestrian and cycle paths the bridge will connect. Situtated at Helsinki(Finland).
